He turned into a monster I didn't recognize. He started hitting Mom for no reason, each time beating her until she wouldn't move before he would stop. Once, after hitting Mom, he saw me crying loudly nearby. He raised his fist and walked towards me. Mom, seeing this, desperately crawled up and rushed over to hold his leg. Dad beat Mom again until she couldn't move, then went into the house. The next day, while Dad was away, I asked Mom: 'Mom, how can we stop Dad from hitting us? I don't want to see you get hit anymore, it hurts me so much...' Mom, with tears in her eyes, smiled and said: 'Sweetie, let's play hide-and-seek, okay? If you win, we won't be hit anymore. But this game is different from when you play with your friends. In this game, Dad and I are both looking for you. If I find you, you win. If Dad finds you, then you run downstairs quickly, don't let Dad catch you, okay?' 'Okay, Mom, I understand!' Another night, Dad came back drunk again. Unsurprisingly, he beat Mom again with fists and kicks. After a while, seeing Mom motionless, Dad went back to his room to rest. After Mom saw him go back, she carefully crawled over to me, curled up in a ball, and said: 'Sweetie, let's start playing hide-and-seek now.' I immediately got up and hid in the large wardrobe in my bedroom, not daring to make a sound. Through the crack in the door, I vaguely saw Mom holding a fruit knife, walking into Dad's bedroom. After a sound of fighting and things breaking, Mom staggered out slowly. Mom opened the wardrobe where I was hiding and said: 'Sweetie won, Dad will never hit us again, Mom will always love you...' After saying that, Mom collapsed, and bright red blood kept flowing from her neck. Mom closed her eyes forever... It turned out that when Mom was trying to kill Dad, Dad wasn't fast asleep. He was awakened by Mom's footsteps, saw Mom holding the knife, and started to struggle for it. During the struggle, Mom's hand holding the knife was grabbed by Dad, and it cut Mom's carotid artery. Blood gushed out continuously. At this moment, Dad was stunned, and Mom took this opportunity to stab the fruit knife into Dad's heart.",
