So, he often asked me to hurt him in various ways. Of course, I was happy to oblige, since this was the reason we became friends. This time, he said he wanted to give me a unique gift.

From then on, though I lost him, he will forever accompany me. I kept his brain and used electronic devices to continue supporting it, placing the brain in the secret base operating table. Through cameras, it sent images to the brain, allowing it to see what I did to other online friends. Every time I saw a sharp fluctuation in the device, I knew that he must have liked my gift.",
